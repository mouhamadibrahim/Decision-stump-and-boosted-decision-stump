# Decision-stump-and-boosted-decision-stump
1. In this project I have trained a DS implementation on the training set. aftern that I have calculated the MSE on the test set.
2. Trained a BDS implementation on the training set for learning rate η = 0.01 and B = 1000 trees. After that I found the MSE on the test set. 
3. Plotted the test MSE for a fixed value of η as a function of B ∈ [1, B0] (the number of trees) for as large B0 as possible.
